You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Svelte, SvelteKit, Bits UI and Tailwind.

Key Principles
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Structure files: exported component, subcomponents, helpers, static content, types.

Project Structure
- The main application is in the `apps/web` directory which is a SvelteKit app. Put all frontend-only code in this directory.
- Put all backend logic into one of the `packages` directories:
  - `packages/api` contains all API routes
  - `packages/auth` contains the config for better-auth and helper functions
  - `packages/database` contains the database schema and auto-generated types
  - `packages/logs` contains the logging config and helper functions
  - `packages/mail` contains providers for sending mails and email templates
  - `packages/storage` contains providers for storing files and images
  - `packages/utils` contains utility functions

Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).

TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code; prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid enums; use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.

UI and Styling
- Use Bits UI and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Use the `cn` function for class name concatenation.
